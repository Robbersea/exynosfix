This is a very simple app that lets you toggle world access permissions to the file /dev/exynos-mem

This file is incorrectly set to world accessible by Samsung, and malicious code can use this to gain root access to your device and blow up anything they want.

The app requires that your device be rooted in order to modify the permissions of this file.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT LEAVE YOUR DEVICE IN A VULNERABLE STATE !
You can build this from source (if paranoid) or grab exynosfix.apk listed above and use the 'Fix It!' button in the app.
